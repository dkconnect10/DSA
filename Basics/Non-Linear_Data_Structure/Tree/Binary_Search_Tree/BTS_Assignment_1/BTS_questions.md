# ===================================================
# Objective: Assignment 20: Binary Search Tree Part-1
# ===================================================

# 1. Define a class Node with instance variables left, item, and right.
#    The variables left and right are used to refer left and right child node.
#    The item variable is used to hold data item.

# 2. Define a class BST to implement Binary Search Tree data structure.
#    Make __init__() method to create root instance variable 
#    to hold the reference of root node.

# 3. In class BST, define insert method to store new data item 
#    in the binary search tree.

# 4. In class BST, define a search method to find a given item 
#    in the binary search tree and return the node reference.
#    It should return None if search failed.

# 5. In class BST, define a method to implement inorder traversal.

# 6. In class BST, define a method to implement preorder traversal.

# 7. In class BST, define a method to implement postorder traversal.
