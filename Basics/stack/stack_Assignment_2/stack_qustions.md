1. Define a class Stack to implement stack data structure by extending the list class.

2. Define a method is_empty() to check if the stack is empty in the Stack class.

3. In Stack class, define push() method to add data onto the stack.

4. In Stack class, define pop() method to remove top element from the stack.

5. In Stack class, define peek() method to return top element on the stack.

6. In Stack class, define size() method to return size of the stack (i.e., number of items present in    the stack).

7. Implement a way to restrict use of insert() method of list class from stack object.
