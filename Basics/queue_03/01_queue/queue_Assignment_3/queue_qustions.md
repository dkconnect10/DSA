# ========================================

"""
1. Define a class Queue to implement the queue data structure using the singly linked list concept.
   Define the __init__() method to initialise 'front' and 'rear' reference variables and 
   an 'item_count' variable to keep track of the number of elements in the queue.

2. Define a method is_empty() in the Queue class to check whether the queue is empty.

3. In the Queue class, define an enqueue() method to insert a new element at the rear of the queue.

4. In the Queue class, define a dequeue() method to remove and return the element from the front of the queue.

5. In the Queue class, define a peek() method to return the front element of the queue without removing it.

6. In the Queue class, define a size() method to return the total number of items in the queue.
