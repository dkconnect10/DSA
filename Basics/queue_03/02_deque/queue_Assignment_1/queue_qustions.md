# Assignment-14: Deque Implementation using List
====================================================


1. Define a class Deque to implement deque data structure using list. Define `__init__()` method to create an empty list object as instance object member of Deque.

2. Define a method `is_empty()` to check if the deque is empty in Deque class.

3. In Deque class, define `insert_front()` method to add data at the front end of the deque.

4. In Deque class, define `insert_rear()` method to add data at the rear end of the deque.

5. In Deque class, define `delete_front()` method to remove front element from the deque.

6. In Deque class, define `delete_rear()` method to remove rear element from the deque.

7. In Deque class, define `get_front()` method to return front element of the deque.

8. In Deque class, define `get_rear()` method to return rear element of the deque.

9. In Deque class, define `size()` method to return size of the deque that is number of items present in the deque.
