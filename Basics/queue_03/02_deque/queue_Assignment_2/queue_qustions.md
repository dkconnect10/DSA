# Assignment-15: Deque using Doubly Linked List Concept
=========================================================

# 1. Define a class Node with instance object member variables prev, item and next.

# 2. Define a class Deque to implement deque data structure using doubly linked list
#    concept. Define __init__() method to initialise front and rear reference variable; and
#    item_count variable to keep track of number of elements in the deque.

# 3. Define a method is_empty() to check if the deque is empty in Deque class.

# 4. In Deque class, define insert_front() method to add data at the front of the deque.

# 5. In Deque class, define insert_rear() method to add data at the rear of the deque.

# 6. In Deque class, define delete_front() method to remove front element from the
#    deque.

# 7. In Deque class, define delete_rear() method to remove rear element from the deque.

# 8. In Deque class, define get_front() method to return front element of the deque.

# 9. In Deque class, define get_rear() method to return rear element of the deque.

# 10. In Deque class, define size() method to return size of the deque that is number of
#     items present in the deque.
