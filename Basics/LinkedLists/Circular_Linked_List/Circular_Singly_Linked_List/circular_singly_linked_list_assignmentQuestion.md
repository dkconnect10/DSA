# Assignment-5: Circular Linked List (DSA using Python)

## Questions

1. Define a class `Node` to describe a node of a circular linked list.
2. Define a class `CLL` to implement Circular Linked List with `__init__()` method to create and initialize the `last` reference variable.
3. Define a method `is_empty()` to check if the linked list is empty in the `CLL` class.
4. In class `CLL`, define a method `insert_at_start()` to insert an element at the start of the list.
5. In class `CLL`, define a method `insert_at_last()` to insert an element at the end of the list.
6. In class `CLL`, define a method `search()` to find the node with a specified element value.
7. In class `CLL`, define a method `insert_after()` to insert a new node after a given node in the list.
8. In class `CLL`, define a method to print all the elements of the list.
9. In class `CLL`, implement an iterator for CLL to access all the elements of the list in a sequence.
10. In class `CLL`, define a method `delete_first()` to delete the first element from the list.
11. In class `CLL`, define a method `delete_last()` to delete the last element from the list.
