# ðŸ“˜ Assignment-2: Doubly Linked List (Python)

## Tasks

1. Define a class `Node` to describe a node of a doubly linked list.
2. Define a class `DLL` to implement Doubly Linked List with the `__init__()` method to create and initialize the `start` reference variable.
3. Define a method `is_empty()` to check if the linked list is empty.
4. Define a method `insert_at_start()` to insert an element at the beginning of the list.
5. Define a method `insert_at_last()` to insert an element at the end of the list.
6. Define a method `search()` to find the node with the specified value.
7. Define a method `insert_after()` to insert a new node after a given node in the list.
8. Define a method `insert_before()` to insert a new node before a given node in the list.
9. Define a method to print all the elements of the list.
10. Implement an iterator to access all the elements of the list in sequence.
11. Define a method `delete_first()` to delete the first element from the list.
12. Define a method `delete_last()` to delete the last element from the list.
13. Define a method `delete_item()` to delete a specified element from the list.
